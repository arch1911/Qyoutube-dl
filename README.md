# Qyoutube-dl
A basic GUI frontend to youtube-dl written using PyQt5. Mostly Unfinished.

youtube-dl is (c) Ricardo Garcia and the project can be found at https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/

#### Implemented
* Most console arguments have a gui option
* All URLs added will be downloaded one at a time
* Loading URL lists from files

#### Untested
* Playlist URL downloading while single video URLs are in the list

#### TODO: 
* Make UI Nicer
* Simultaneous downloads
* Parse console output and put it in the GUI (ETA, download speed, etc. should go in the gui)
* Each video to download should have its own settings (Say if downloading two different playlists but you want different options for them)
* Make the program portable
